Quicker way to search and add the words:
iterate through the entire article and add the words to a hashmap
If those words show up on the english side of the deal, then we know and can quickly look it up

We're actually doing that either way aren't we...

I don't need to do this cache UP FRONT, but I can implement it as we go forward

Exclusion list for common words
    -> add highlight and right click to add words to never translate
Cache for common words

TODO - make translate API work in extension
    BUNDLING -> Webpack or Browserify
