TODOs:
-chunks of words within a sentence -> translate this chunk of X words with some variance for words after that limit
-do not translate word list
-fixed seed or page for debugging
-option to change what counts as a short sentence
-live update page as we change settings








Figure out exactly how exports and modules work.


Create popup interface
    -> design mockup for what it should do

Check if word replace works with Arabic (god help us if not)

Quicker way to search and add the words:
iterate through the entire article and add the words to a hashmap
If those words show up on the english side of the deal, then we know and can quickly look it up

We're actually doing that either way aren't we...

I don't need to do this cache UP FRONT, but I can implement it as we go forward

Exclusion list for common words
    -> add highlight and right click to add words to never translate
Cache for common words

TODO - make translate API work in extension
    BUNDLING -> Webpack or Browserify

How the fuck would user authentication work if I were to push this out into the wild?


Test site:

When we change, we run the script again, but we don't restore the page to its original state
We can do the stupid way and just save the entire page to local storage, but that makes this fucker huge


User authentication over the API to ensure we have valid requests

//////

Handling multiple arabic words translated in a row (reverse em)
Or, just skip it and do the sentence implementation
Language selector
Dynamically turn it on and off
    -> backups of the page that we flip in between

Translate blacklist -> that, the, he, she, we, etc

Context menu implementation to add words to a block list

________

Can I make transalte API translate brand names?
Context menu -> untranslate this sentence


/// How to implement multiple languages?
    -> French, Russian

/// Context menu stuff -> save sentence, etc

Translating brand names -> seems to work when we add "" around the word -> may take a given sentence and go work by word, instead of using the sentence regex.
Word by word, add quotes, take it back, strip the quotes, use it to build the sentence anew.
