Figure out exactly how exports and modules work.

Quicker way to search and add the words:

Exclusion list for common words

Cache for common words

TODO - make translate API work in extension
    BUNDLING -> Webpack or Browserify

User authentication over the API to ensure we have valid requests

Handling multiple arabic words translated in a row (reverse em)
Or, just skip it and do the sentence implementation
Language selector
Dynamically turn it on and off
    -> backups of the page that we flip in between

Translate blacklist -> that, the, he, she, we, etc

Context menu implementation to add words to a block list
